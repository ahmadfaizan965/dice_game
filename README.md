# JavaScript Dice Game
<br>
<p>It is a simple game between Player and Computer. It randomly generates two different dice numbers, by which the winner of the game decide. I have coded this for my JS practice. Topics covered are <strong>JS function, variable, randomisation, DOM Manipulation etc</strong></p>
